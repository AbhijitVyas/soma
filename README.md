SOMA -- the **SO**cio-physical **M**odel of **A**ctivities -- is an ontological model of activities that attempts to equip robotic agents with abstract knowledge to make them perform activities in a more flexible and robust manner.
*SÃ´ma* is also a word for *body* derived from Ancient Greek, and *body* being a central aspect in this model due to severe difficulties of controlling the body of an agent in the physical world.
More concretely, the scope of SOMA is how agents interact with their environment in terms of what are their intentions, what is their plan, how do they move, and how do they get into contact with each other or items in the environment.
