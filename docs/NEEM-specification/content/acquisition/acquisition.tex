\section{NEEM-Acquisition}
This chapter focuses on the acquisition process of \neems.
At first, we will provide the tools and procedures to acquire episodic memories from robots performing experiments.
The second section focuses on the \neem acquisition from virtual reality. 

Each section will contain an example \neem to provide insights how the representation, described in Chapter \ref{chap:represenation}, is utilized to represent performed activities by robots or by humans. 
In addition, each example \neem is available on the \neemhub for downloading.
