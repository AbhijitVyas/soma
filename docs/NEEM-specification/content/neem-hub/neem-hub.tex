\todo{@Seba, give an overview about the concept and idea about the NEEM Hub}
In this chapter we have to describe, how the NEEM narrative and \neemexp should be represented e.g.\ using \owl and \mongodb and how the partners can upload those file to \openease.

\section{Prerequisite}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Due to security reasons our Hadoop Cluster can be only accessed via the University's intranet right now.	
	\item Install DVC https://dvc.org/ and get familiar with the tool https://dvc.org/doc/start.
	\item Install Hadoop \todo{@Seba write tutorial or find good link which explains it}. 
			To test if your setup is correctly installed you can try to download this test neem repo
	\item To be able to publish your data, you are required to have a git account on our gitlab.
	https://neemgit.informatik.uni-bremen.de/
\end{enumerate}


\section{Publishing}
At the time of writing this document, we are intending to host 3 groups of data:
\begin{description}
	\item[Raw data]
		We define might be data which cannot be captured directly as NEEMs during the acquisition.
	\item[\neems] 
	\item[Processed Data]
\end{description}

In the future, you will be able to publish your transformers which transform raw data into \neems or the \neems into processed data.
This will allow to share your tools easily with the community and also automatize data transformation pipeline.
