\subsubsection{Properties}
\label{sec:qualification}

Qualities are the properties of an object that are not part of it, but cannot exist without it.
This is, for example, the quality of having a shape -- a quality inherited by all physical objects.
Another example is the quality of a floor being slippery.
A robot navigating on such a floor could use this knowledge to avoid, for example,
spillage when moving on the floor with a coffee-filled cup.
The quality concept does not directly encode the value of the object property, but only focusses on characteristics of the property itself.
This is mainly useful in cases where individual aspects of an entity are considered in the domain of discourse.

Each object property has one value at a time. The value of an object property is called \emph{region}.
The value itself is an element, or a sub-region in some dimensional
space such as \emph{time interval} or \emph{space region}.
A region may be a finite set of discrete labels, allowing for ``qualitative'' descriptions,
but more often a region is some dimensional space allowing ``quantitative'' descriptions.
A Region may contain a single point, in cases where the value of a property is known precisely.
Note that the domain of the relation \emph{hasRegion} is not \emph{Quality} but \emph{Entity}.
This is to allow assigning regions to entities without explicating the quality as a concept (quality-as-relation).
\todo{Seba: maybe some more example would be nice. Or refering to the example with the slippery floor. }
