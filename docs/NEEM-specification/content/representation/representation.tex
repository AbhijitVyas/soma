% One of the most powerful components of the human memory system is the
% episodic memory. 
When somebody talks about the deciding goal in the
last soccer world championship many of us can ``replay'' the episode
in our ``mind's eye''. %, or if somebody talks about a cross court hit
%in tennis we can recall how such a hit feels in the arm.
The memory
mechanism that allows us to recall these very detailed pieces of
information from abstract descriptions is our episodic memory.
Episodic memory is powerful because it allows us to remember special
experiences we had. It can also serve as a ``repository'' from which
we learn general knowledge.

% NOTE: taken from KnowRob2.0
EASE integrates episodic memories
deeply into the knowledge acquisition, representation, and processing
system. Whenever a robotic agent performs, observes, prospects, and
reads about an activity, it creates an episodic memory. An episodic
memory is best understood as a video that the agent makes of the
ongoing activity 
%in its inner world knowledge base
coupled with a very
detailed story about the actions, motions, their purposes, effects,
the behavior they generate, the images that are captured, etc.

\section{Extending the Representation}
\label{sec:extension}
\subsubsection{New Tasks Definition}
\label{sec:extension,subsec:task}
\todo{Text is copied from the robot-neem section.}
A task might be something like cutting, stopping or accelerating.
To be able to semantically log the task, you will need first define the task in the \easeAct.
Make sure that the new action is a child of the \textit{CommunicationTask}, \textit{MentalTask} or \textit{PhysicalTask}.
