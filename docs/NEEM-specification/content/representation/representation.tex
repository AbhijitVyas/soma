\chapter{Representation}
\label{chap:represenation}

\neems are representations of experiences acquired through experimentation, reading, observing, mental simulation, etc.
The main goal is to establish a common vocabulary used to annotate experience data across different tasks, scientific disciplines, and modalities of acquisition, and to define schemata for quantitative experience data.
The vocabulary is not just a set of atomic labels, but each label has a formal definition in an ontology.
These definitions are done such that a set of \emph{competency questions} about an activitiy can be answered by a knowledge base that is equipped with the ontology and a collection of \neems.

The purpose of this chapter is not to provide a full overview about the ontological modelling underlying \neems, but rather to concentrate on aspects that are directly relevant when a \neem is created.
These are class labels, relationships, and structures (Section~\ref{ch:narrative}), and experience data (Section~\ref{ch:experience}).

\section{Extending the Representation}
\label{sec:extension}
\subsubsection{New Tasks Definition}
\label{sec:extension,subsec:task}
\todo{Text is copied from the robot-neem section.}
A task might be something like cutting, stopping or accelerating.
To be able to semantically log the task, you will need first define the task in the \easeAct.
Make sure that the new action is a child of the \textit{CommunicationTask}, \textit{MentalTask} or \textit{PhysicalTask}.
